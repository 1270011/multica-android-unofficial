/**
 * The scrolling timeline. ASC chronological — oldest at top, newest near the
 * bottom (above the composer). Pull-to-refresh refetches issue + timeline.
 *
 * Backend returns the full timeline in one shot (server-side pagination
 * was dropped in #2322 — p99 ~30 entries per issue, cursor walking only
 * created bugs at reply-thread boundaries). The previous "Pull to load
 * older" UX and top-edge `fetchOlder` trigger are gone.
 *
 * Inbox deep-link — FlashList v2 `initialScrollIndex`:
 *   When `highlightCommentId` is set, the list lands on the row of that
 *   comment (a reply lands on its root's row, see `findLandingIndex`) with
 *   the comment's start at the top of the viewport. Web centers the target
 *   instead (`packages/views/issues/components/issue-detail.tsx`, landing
 *   effect); on a phone a comment is often taller than half the screen, so
 *   centering would cut off its beginning. Without a target, or when the
 *   comment is not in the timeline (deleted, notification without
 *   comment), the list opens at the issue header like a normal issue-open.
 *
 *   We pass the index as `initialScrollIndex` and remount the list via
 *   `key={`hl-${highlightNonce}`}` once timeline data has arrived.
 *   FlashList then lays out from that row and scrolls to it before the
 *   first paint; after that MVCP keeps the visible content stable while
 *   the rows above get measured and async resizes land (Shiki highlight,
 *   image natural-size, WS `comment:updated`). No JS-side scroll dance.
 *
 * Before this change the deep-link used `startRenderingFromBottom`, i.e.
 *   it always landed at the END of the thread and the user had to scroll
 *   up to the target and to title/status/description — on long threads
 * that was a long way. An older hand-rolled `landed` state
 *   gate that re-fired `scrollToEnd` on every `onContentSizeChange`
 *   deadlocked the user at the bottom (state-vs-event race); that is why
 *   the landing must stay a one-shot inside FlashList.
 *
 *   The matching <CommentCard>'s `RootHighlightOverlay` fires when the
 *   target row enters the render window — with the landing above that is
 *   right on arrival. `HIGHLIGHT_HOLD_MS` (5s) is the window for that.
 *
 *   Why not `scrollToIndex` after mount: it requires accurate height
 *   estimates that variable-height markdown bubbles can't provide, even
 *   with `onScrollToIndexFailed` retry (web hit the same wall and splits
 *   into virtualized-for-browse / flat-for-deep-link). `initialScrollIndex`
 *   does not need estimates for the rows above: it starts rendering AT the
 *   target and lets MVCP absorb the corrections.
 *
 * `maintainVisibleContentPosition` is enabled by default on FlashList v2
 * and is implemented inside the C++ shadow tree — it compensates the
 * scroll offset both when a row is INSERTED above the viewport AND when
 * an upper row RESIZES (a WS `comment:updated` / `reaction:added` /
 * `resolved` event on an older comment used to push the user's read
 * position down by the delta). On FlatList the same prop was iOS-only
 * + JS-side; the FlashList path is steadier and animates the offset
 * compensation rather than snapping it.
 *
 * List engine: FlashList v2 (Shopify). Migrated from FlatList because:
 *   1. Cell recycling — markdown bubbles (Shiki highlight, image natural-
 *      size, lightbox provider injection) are expensive to mount; FlashList
 *      keeps them in recycled cells when scrolling through history rather
 *      than re-running the multi-pass render each time a row re-enters the
 *      window.
 *   2. Native MVCP — see paragraph above. Smoother behavior than FlatList's
 *      JS-side implementation when WS events resize an upper row.
 *   3. Async-render stability — async markdown size changes inside the
 *      viewport no longer cause the visual "twitch" we saw with FlatList,
 *      because FlashList re-layouts inside the shadow tree without
 *      surfacing a JS-side onContentSizeChange storm.
 *
 * What FlashList v2 does NOT change about this file:
 *   - `startRenderingFromBottom` is NOT enabled: a normal issue-open
 *     shows the header (title, description, status) first, an Inbox
 *     deep-link lands on its comment (see above), neither jumps straight
 *     to the latest reply.
 *   - Spacing between rows. FlashList ignores `gap-*` on
 *     `contentContainer` the same way it does in chat-message-list.tsx —
 *     we use `ItemSeparatorComponent` for the 12 px breathing room and
 *     `ListHeaderComponentStyle` to add the same gap below the header.
